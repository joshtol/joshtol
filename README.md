## 🧠 About Me
I'm **Joshua Tollette** — AI Architect & Engineer passionate about designing and building **scalable, intelligent systems**.  
I specialize in multi‑agent architectures, AI‑driven automation, and leveraging modern tools like **Go**, **Python**, and **Docker** to bring complex ideas to life.

Currently, I’m focused on an R&D project called the **Wild Research Framework** — an exploration into creating efficient and specialized AI swarms.
