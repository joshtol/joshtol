</p>

**Real-time particle animation engine for AI interfaces with emotion-driven motion and musical beat synchronization**

Emotive Engine is an open-source animation library that brings emotional intelligence to user interfaces through particle-based visualizations. Designed for AI assistants, chatbots, and interactive experiences, it transforms abstract emotional states into expressive visual animations.

**Key Features:**
- üé≠ **12 Rich Emotions** - Joy, calm, excited, love, focused, and more
- üéµ **Musical Time Sync** - Animations sync to beats, not milliseconds
- üí´ **Shape Morphing** - Circle, heart, star, sun, moon with smooth transitions
- ‚ö° **High Performance** - 60 FPS on mobile with adaptive quality
- üîå **Framework Agnostic** - Works with React, Vue, vanilla JS
- üì¶ **Production Ready** - 336 passing tests, zero vulnerabilities

## üöÄ Flagship Project: The Wild Research Framework

The Wild Research Framework is a proprietary system for orchestrating large-scale AI swarms. As the architect, I designed the system to be highly modular, scalable, and capable of supporting thousands of concurrent agents with sub-100ms decision cycles.

  </picture>
</p>

<h4 align="center">Core Architectural Achievement: The Queen-Drone Model</h4>

At the heart of the framework is the **Queen-Drone architecture**, a novel approach to swarm management that enables both centralized strategy and decentralized execution. This design has allowed for:

- **Massive Scalability:** Simulated and deployed swarms of over 1,000 agents.
- **Real-time Performance:** Achieved sub-100ms decision-making cycles in complex simulations.
- **Efficient Orchestration:** A robust gRPC-based communication layer for high-throughput data exchange.

## üìà Vision & Applications

My work spans two critical domains of modern AI:

**üé® Emotional AI Interfaces**
Creating intuitive, human-centric interactions through real-time emotional visualization. Emotive Engine demonstrates how particle systems and musical timing can transform cold AI interactions into warm, engaging experiences.

**üëë Autonomous AI Systems**
Building scalable multi-agent architectures for complex problem-solving. The Wild Research Framework shows how thousands of AI agents can coordinate seamlessly for enterprise-grade automation.

**Potential Applications:**
- **AI Assistants & Chatbots:** Emotionally responsive interfaces that feel alive
- **Logistics & Supply Chain:** Autonomous drone fleets for warehouse management
- **Healthcare:** Patient interfaces with calming, empathetic avatars
- **Cybersecurity:** Swarms of AI agents detecting threats in real-time
- **Education:** Engaging, emotionally-aware learning platforms
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Coordinated sensor networks for climate response

I am currently seeking opportunities to apply these technologies to real-world challenges and explore new frontiers in AI systems.

## üéØ Current Focus

- Building **Emotive Engine** community and exploring applications in healthcare, education, and customer support.
- Scaling **Wild Research Framework** into a deployable, modular AI swarm library.
- Experimenting with swarm ethics & emergent behaviors for real‚Äëworld safety.
- Exploring cross‚Äëdomain applications of emotional AI and multi‚Äëagent collaboration.
